# About this project...
"*What is this thing supposed to be?*", some of you might ask.\
Well, it's a compiler I wrote in pure C myself, at the pristine age of *16.*\
But! Before you start questioning if I am really *the reincarnation of Terry A. Davis in the flesh*, consider this.
I was heavily inspired by Matthew Oros on YouTube who published his coding journey for all to see.
Here is his github repository holding the project I followed closely, but without copying:\
[orosmatthew/hydrogen-cpp: A hobby programming language]{https://github.com/orosmatthew/hydrogen-cpp}\
Ok, well now you know I kinda cheated... But wait before thy judgment bestows damage upon my pride, for I have indeed surpassed my Master.\
Well, I indeed surpassed the one who started my project, because I wrote my own version of the compiler structure he used, except in C.\
If that ain't convincing enough, if you take a look at his language, it still doesnt have a while loop, printing, input, etc.\
"*Nah I'd win.*", I said nonchalantly as I published this repo.\
Ok, enough with the weird boasting, now let's get to business.\

# The Exodia (The Forbidden One) Programming Language
, or the Exo programming language for short.\
This programming language does not have a `main()` function, but does use the same logic as python, where the code in the source is ran automatically.\
Now what features does this programming language have? Or what features does the compiler have?
- 64-bit Integer values and variables
- Character values and variables (not fully implemented yet...)
- Scopes, Control flow and Loops
- Standard functions such as `println()`, `printnum()`, `getnum()` and `obliterate()`
- Mathematical operations such as +, -, \*, \/ and %\
\
Ok, well that's cool and all, but what is the current support for this?
- Linux only for now
- Needs to have the *nasm* Assembler installed
- Needs to have the *GNU Linker* (*aka `ld`*)

# Repository specifications
Read my code if you want, but I won't accept any pull requests or whatever.
That is simply because I want to write my compiler myself, and with my genius instead of yours.\
"*Didn't you already cheat bro?*"\
Now, my answer to this is simple. Please read my code and Matthew's code and now tell me if I copied.\
I'm just better bro. Also, like mentioned before, I am currently 16 years old, so if my code is a warcrime, please spare your slurs.\

Thanks for reading, I'm DioDogHater. *(i don't actually hate dogs btw)*
